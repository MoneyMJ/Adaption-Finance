Introduction
Over the past decades, it is quite evident that climate change leading to loss of property and
damage is not a distant possibility but a happening reality. (Parry et al. 1 ) Repeated failures
to limit the greenhouse gas emissions to a safe level, have exposed the negligence of the re-
sponsible parties to the Adaption finance forefront, leaving the most vulnerable communities
on the brink of demise. It is interesting to see how political relations marginalize the e!ect
of global CSR initiatives. In this work, we closely review the evolution of Adaption Finance
as a solution to hedge adverse impact caused by human-induced climate change. (Burton 2 )
Financial resources dedicated to supporting climate change initiatives are referred to as cli-
mate finance. Climate change can happen either due to natural processes or it could be
human-induced. Discussions concerning climate change started as early as 1960s with initial
aim of weather monitoring and how will it a!ect global ecosystems. (Miller 3 ) Gradually,
the focus shifted to how to tackle or reverse the climate change which is directly associated
to the human activities. After lot of debate, Scientists agreed in limiting the anthropogenic
sources of greenhouse gas emissions. This aspect of abating the GHG emissions was the
essence of Mitigation finance. (Halimanjaya 4 )
To achieve this goal, UNFCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change)
was formed in 1992 for serving as a global policy. Hence, mitigation policy as a concept was
the heart of the global climate change regime, due to the root cause identified for the climate
change to be emissions of GHG. Subsequent years went in negotiating the Kyoto Protocol,
1
with underlying focus mitigation, which was adopted in 1997. (Telesetsky 5 ) In order to
put the protocol in e!ect, there were certain queries to be resolved which were discussed in
1998 Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA).(Halvorssen 6 ) However, the negotiations broke
down leading to conflicts which halted the adoption of the rules until COP-11 in 2005, when
Marrakesh Accords (Wirth 7 ) were adopted.
The take on adaption was slightly di!erent than mitigation in the sense that mitigation ef-
forts were revolving around reduction of emissions, while adaption focus was to address the
consequences of climate change. It was quite evident that the e!ects of mitigation e!orts
won’t be visible in the near future due to the time lag in implementation, so to minimise
unwanted climate changes happening in real-time, adaption finance had to be prioritised
with e!ect.(Burton 8 )
Hence, in theory, mitigation and adaption were complementary as in the more mitigation is
done, lesser the adaption e!orts would be required and vice versa. Surprisingly, in reality
both policies were seen as an alternative to each other by the policy makers since their in-
ception, due to di!erence in opinions and perceptions.(Schipper 9 )
Due to the overlooking of adaption finance by the policy makers in early 1990s, there was
a pressure from the scholars for highlighting the need for Adaption to be as prominent as
Mitigation in coming years. In 2001, adaption as a solution gained the deserved prominence
via Marrakesh Accords.(Wirth 7 )
Tracking of Adaption Finance:
Adaption, owing to its multi-dimensional nature, was a topic of confusion and debate for
several years during late 1990s and early 2000s. In the early 1990s, Waggoner depicted this
dilemma as "the first obstacle to adaptation is reluctance to contemplate it".(Waggoner 10 )
There was no o"cial definition of Adaption finance given by the UNFCC, however, during
the convention’s intergovernmental negotiating committee (INC) process, it was identified
as ‘all purposeful and deliberate activity taken in response to or in anticipation of the ad-
verse e!ects of rapid climate change by a submission from Australia and New Zealand. The
2
definition provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was "Adjustment
in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their ef-
fects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities." (Skaalvik and Sevaldsen 11 )
Adaption could be further categorised as "anticipatory and reactive adaptation, private and
public adaptation, and autonomous and planned adaptation". (Skaalvik and Sevaldsen 11 )
Adaption was described as a distraction from mitigation e!orts by the analysts. The idea of
accepting adaption was associated with a ’defeatist’ option(Parry et al. 1 ), and there was a
scare that it would be used by the Industrial countries to divert from the emissions reduction
monitoring (Apuuli et al. 12 ). Another major cause of early negligence was the overestima-
tion of mitigation e!ectiveness. (Halimanjaya 4 ) However, with the gradual uncovering of
blockers in the e!orts it was clear that there is a clear misalignment in what was thought and
what we achieved. These blockers in advancing mitigation techniques compelled developing
nations to seek adaption as the strategy to look forward for.(Roberts et al. 13 )
As evident, there was no major emphasis by 1992 UNFCC (Bodansky 14 ) and Kyoto proto-
col (Telesetsky 5 ). From the initial understanding to current view, adaption evolved slowly.
Alliance of of Small Island States (AOSIS, since 1991) played a huge role in putting pres-
sure on developed nations to acknowledge vulnerability and adaption issues. One of the
major reasons for political conflicts among the countries was the argument of "polluter pays
principle"(Apuuli et al. 12 ), wherein the environmentalists argued that the countries should
pay on the basis of their di!erentiated responsibilities and capabilities. (Füssel 15 ) It was
widely debated that the countries who are least contributors are the most vulnerable to the
harmful e!ects of climate changes. Keeping in mind, Convention established the leadership
role of Industrial countries (’Annex I Countries’) for climate change damage control. AIC
were supposed to help NAICs in implementation and incremental e!orts.(Müller 16 ) In 1995,
during the COP1 in Berlin, for the first time, there was a discussion for adaption activity
funding. There was a suggestion in COP1 to utilise GEF (Global Environmental Facility)
to finance adaption needs. GEF was established as a pilot program in 1991 under the World
3
Bank. (Reed 17 ) In order to find the most vulnerable countries and people, it was important
to indicate the priority of adaption. Adaptive Capacity (Engle 18 ) was used as an indicator
to reflect one entity’s tolerance to change in climate. Insurance as an instrument of adaption
was first suggested by AOSIS. As far as funding was concerned (Garrido et al. 19 ), wealthy
AICs initially resisted to commit to any fund provisions, due to their liability with regards
to GHG emissions. (Füssel 15 ) COP7 in 2001 proved to be a significant upturn for adaption
awareness with Marrakesh Accords (Wirth 7 ), which led to formation of a) Special Climate
Change Fund (SCCF), b) Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), and c) Adaption Fund
(AF) under the KP. The promising point for AF was that the funding derived from Clean De-
velopment Mechanism (CDM) (Fankhauser and Martin 20 ), which is not associated with any
government. There is a 2% levy on CDM certified emissions which fund the AF. Most of the
CDM projects were hosted by then developing countries (India, Brazil, China)(Fankhauser
and Martin 20 ). Next major milestone for adaption happened in COP12 (Kenya) where the
structure of AF was finalized and there were calls for adoption of separate adaption protocol
(Okereke et al. 21 ).
In COP14 held in Poznan, public & private insurance schemes were discussed to address
damages caused by extreme weather events. A major setback happened in COP15 when
a group of companies (USA, Brazil, South Africa, China and India) undermined Kyoto
framework and turned to ’bottom-up’ structure for pledges of emission reduction.(Khan and
Roberts 22 ) As per KP, e!orts were to limit the increase in global temperature not more than
2 degrees Celsius, however with this new approach sum of individual emissions was resulting
in 3.0–5.0 degrees of warming.(Khan and Roberts 22 ) The developed nations pledged $30
bn as ’fast track’ finance to the developing countries and $100bn annually moving forward.
This funding was decided to flow via Green Climate Fund (Bowman and Minas 23 ), which
came into e!ect finally in COP18 (Doha). Although there was skepticism of how much of
the pledged amount will actually be provided, and the claim of providing $10bn news and
additional fund failed miserably as it was found that only 33% of these funds were new, with
4
majority of them a loans. As the trend emerged, adaption financing too various branches and
instruments but was too scattered to make synergies globally because of which, the scaling
of adaption e!orts remained out of question.
Sources and Trend of Adaption Finance Majority of public finance commitments were from
DFIs followed by Governments and then Climate Funds. The instruments mainly constituted
of grants, insurance, low-cost debt, and equity.(Neufeldt et al. 24 ). As per the UNEP Adap-
tion gap report of 2015, Estimated costs of adaptation in 2030 was likely to be in the range
of US$140-300 billion per annum, with the adaption finance available $26 bn. These huge
adaption gap was an alarming figure to sustainability. The funding commitments mainly fo-
cused on certain sectors namely agriculture, water, coastal & health.(Neufeldt et al. 24 ) The
Paris Agreement restated the 2020 commitment by developed country parties of mobilizing
US$100 billion per year for adaptation and mitigation until 2025, and requires parties to
increase that commitment after 2025.(Clémençon 25 )
ODA (Klein et al. 26 ) constituted Grants (66%) and Loans (32%), while in bilateral DFIs,
most common instrument was low-cost loans(80%). Market Rate loans (84%) formed the
bulk of multi-lateral DFIs. (Neufeldt et al. 24 )
In 2020, NbS became a popular concept (Nature-based solutions) as they are inexpensive
options that may be successful in lowering climate risks. (Seddon et al. 27 ) NbS can play
a significant role in climate change adaptation. Although higher degrees of climate change
may restrict the e!ectiveness of NbS, which further underlines need for intact mitigation
activity to guarantee the future contribution to adaptation.
Over the last couple of years, Multilateral development banks and bilateral banks form the
major finance providers of adaption for adaption related projects. From 2012 to 2023, bilat-
eral flows proportion increased for adaption projects and reduced for mitigation.(Müller 16 )
Themes in Academic Records: Early existing literature on adaption finance covered con-
ceptual history (Schipper 9 ), funding options for adaption finance (Mace 28 ) (Mace 29 ), and
tracing the adaption policy post 1992. (Gupta 30 ) The review on adaption policy by Khan
5
(Khan and Roberts 22 ) studies the evolution by dividing two decades post 1992 into 3 peri-
ods.
With the increasing importance of Adaption finance in late 2010s, a lot of scholars started
exploring the research gaps in the domain. The main themes studied revolved around:
a) Suggesting alternative financing mechanisms to aid in bridging the adaption gap: With
the absence of appropriate funding practices in place, new financial instruments were dis-
cussed to increase the adaption funding like Carbon tax approach (Seo 31 ), levy on CDM
(Fankhauser and Martin 20 ), and CCFM.(Bals et al. 32 )
b) Measuring Adaptive Capacity: Adaptive capacity is an indicator which aids in prioritizing
which country/sector/region should receive the funding first. This domain further goes on
to evaluate the ’Contribution vs Responsibility’ of individual countries and how to define
vulnerability aspects. Indicator-based assessment to validate inequity in distribution of re-
sponsibility, and vulnerability was also a popular theme. (Füssel 15 )
d)Analysing funds e!ectiveness: Another group of researchers are evaluating if the dedicated
climate funds are able to disburse and collect the required numbers to maintain the adaption
needs.(Buchner et al. 33 )
Other themes include ’linking with Mitigation Finance’ (Halimanjaya 4 ), ’Relation with De-
velopment Finance’(Ayers and Huq 34 ), ’Scaling climate adaption to urban areas’.(Brugmann 35 )
Issues And Challenges in Future:
The UNEP reports clearly state how far o! are the adaption e!orts and the optimal levels.
There is a huge mindset issue of countries when it comes to tackle the climate change, be-
cause they consider the funding as a ’charity’ and not ’duty’. Countries like UK, Germany,
US and Japan even went on to relabel their other e!orts of climate control to fast-start
finance just to fulfil their recent pledges, calling into credibility of the whole initiatives and
damage of trust across world. Lack of Coordination in the e!orts for adaption has led to
6
fragmentation complicating overall mechanism, delaying projects completion and hindering
the assessment of current e!orts.
